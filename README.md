# Optimizing the Optimizers

Horiseons came to me with a an issue: *"How can we reach more potential leads without drastically altering the webpage that our established clients already know and love?"* I like to think I provided them with a solution by doing for them what they do for their clients. My first impression of their site is that it was very neatly presented, with all its components working in perfect harmony. Upon a few moments I noticed some of their clickable elements weren't working adequately. That is what prompted me to 'look under the hood' and that is when I noticed that it was missing some *not-so-apparent* key elements. 

## All about hitting the right notes

I started by identifying the individual pieces and how they all fit into the grand design. Once that was established, it was just a matter of identifying where the changes had to be made. The CSS file is where most of the tweaks occurred. Some of the different selectors were redundant ,and with simple changes to certain CSS selectors some of the styling was easily condensed into one category. This simplified the styling by reducing the amount of tags being used. "Alt" elements were added to optimize the website's accesibility. Again, everything was done without altering the website's essence. I am hopeful that the client will be satisfied with what was done all in the name of optimization.

 ##### Footnote: First Steps

I will always remember this project as my starting point. It was adequately designed to cement the foundations of what I had learned up to that point. The "acceptance criteria" section of the original README.md file was a nice touch; it served as a guide without giving too much away. Information presented that way challenged me to think back on what I've learned in order to complete this challenge. Can't beat that feeling caused by those "A-ha moments" when my refactoring worked as it was supposed to ,and did not butchered the website.
