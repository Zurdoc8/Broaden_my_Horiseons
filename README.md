# Weekly Challenge 01 - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

This project was adequately designed to cement the foundations of this course. Most of what I learned during module 1 was applied during this challenge. The "acceptance criteria" section of the original README.md file was a nice touch; it served as a guide without giving too much away. Information presented that way challenged me to think back on what I've learned in order to complete this challenge. Can't beat that feeling caused by those "A-ha moments" when my refactoring worked as it was supposed to ,and did not butchered the website. 

## All about hitting the right notes
I started by identifying the individual pieces and how they all fit into the grand design. Once that was established, it was just a matter of identifying where the changes had to be made. The CSS file is where most of the tweaks occurred. Some of the different selectors were redundant ,and with simple changes to certain CSS selectors some of the styling was easily condensed into one category. This simplified the styling by reducing the amount of tags being used. "Alt" elements were added to optimize the website's accesibility. Again, everything was done without altering the website's essence. I am hopeful that the client will be satisfied with what was done all in the name of optimization.
